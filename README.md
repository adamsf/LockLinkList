# Homework 5: mutex lock linked list
## Francis Adams and Henry Burke

To compile our code on on the Lab Machines:

- download our .zip file onto the machine, the files contained within it should be list.h, testParallel.c, and the Makefile
- Run make in the terminal. This will compile the necessary files for testing
- run the test.exe executable in the command line. Assuming our implementation is correct, this will show the following:
- - the linked list being created
  - the threads being created
  - items being concurrently added and removed from the linked list
  - the linked list being deleted
  - output corresponding to all of the above in the terminal
